# Customer Feedback Data Generation Script

This script generates a synthetic dataset of customer feedback, including randomly generated customer information, product reviews, ratings, and other relevant details. The data is generated using the Python libraries `faker`, `random`, `datetime`, and `multiprocessing` for efficient parallel data generation. The dataset is saved as a CSV file, which can be used for various purposes such as analysis, training machine learning models, or simulating real-world customer interactions.

## Features

- Generates a customizable number of synthetic customer feedback entries.
- Randomizes customer names, feedback text, sentiment, product names, and other details.
- Supports parallel data generation for faster processing on multi-core systems.
- Saves the generated dataset to a CSV file.
- Handles large datasets by writing in chunks to avoid memory overload.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

- `pandas`
- `faker`
- `tqdm`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas faker tqdm
